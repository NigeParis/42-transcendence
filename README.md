# ft_transcendence

**ft_transcendence** is the final web project of **42 School**, designed to bring together everything learned throughout the curriculum into a single, full-stack application.  
This project focuses on building a modern, secure, and scalable web platform that combines real-time multiplayer gameplay, user management, and social interaction.

The application is built with a robust backend using **Fastify**, a dynamic frontend framework, and a **SQLite** database. It features remote authentication, live chat, matchmaking, and multiple games (including server-side Pong and Tic-Tac-Toe), all while emphasizing cybersecurity, DevOps practices, and accessibility.

ft_transcendence aims to deliver a complete user experience, from authentication and statistics dashboards to real-time gameplay and microservice-based architecture.
